= utc-dates

A simple date formatting/parsing library that (by default)
normalizes all formatted dates to UTC, and assumes all date
strings are indicated in UTC.

The default date format (held by `*date-format*`) is:

`yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`

which can be dynamically rebound as desired.

All dates emitted by `parse` will have their time zone shifted
to the local environment's.

If it wasn't obvious, this is not meant to be a general-purpose
date/time library.  Its intended use is to offer a simple API
useful for representing/consuming dates within
lexicographically-sensitive database systems (e.g. couchdb,
AWS SimpleDB, etc).
